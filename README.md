# Spooky Run

"Spooky Run" is a web based 2D arcade style game that allows players to play as a lost dog finding its way back home through a spooky forest. The game is built using vanilla JavaScript and utilizes HTML5 and the `canvas` element to render graphics and handle user input. Players can attack various monsters using different techniques and score points. The game also includes magic element which allows the player to perform rolling fire attack. Optimization techniques were used to ensure smooth performance on desktop computers. Overall, "Spooky Run" offers a rich and stable gameplay experience for fans of arcade style games.

## Game objective

In this game, the player's aim is to achieve a score of over 30 in order to win. The player starts with five lives, but each time they are hit by a monster, they lose one life. The game features three types of enemies, each worth a different amount of points: flying enemies are worth one point, ground enemies are worth two points, and climbing enemies are worth three points. However, if a monster manages to exit the left side of the screen, one point is deducted from the player's score.
